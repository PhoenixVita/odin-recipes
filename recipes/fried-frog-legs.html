                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon minced onion</li>
                <li>2 eggs (don't steal from Aya)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
                <li>1 cup peanut oil for frying</li>
                <l1>1/2 cup cornmeal</l1><br>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse baka frog legs and pat dry; set aside. Combine flour, cornmeal, saltine cracker crumbs, pepper, salt, and onion in a large resealable bag; shake well to mix. Whisk eggs and milk together in a shallow bowl.</li>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil and peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. The oil should be about 1/2 inch deep.</li>
                <li>Dip legs into egg mixture in batches, then press into cracker mixture until evenly coated. Place the breaded legs, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining legs.</li>
                <li>Lower breaded legs carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining frog legs.</li>
            </ol>
