                -Cirno, The Strongest Fairy
            </p>
        </div>
        <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-style: italic;"><p>Cirno is an ice fairy who lives near the Misty Lake in Gensokyo. She is exceptionally strong for her kind,
             but also childish and sometimes considered idiotic by other characters.
             She likes to freeze frogs and play with them, but one day she had a brilliant idea: why not eat them?</p>
        <p>She decided to become a chef and learn how to cook frogs in various ways.
             She experimented with different recipes, such as fried frog legs, frog soup, frog stew, frog ice cream and even frog cake.
              She invited her friends, the Three Fairies of Light, to taste her dishes, but they were not very impressed.
               They thought her food was too cold, too bland or too weird.</p>
        <p>Cirno did not give up on her culinary dream.
             She challenged other chefs in Gensokyo to cook-offs, hoping to prove her skills and learn from them.
              She faced Reimu Hakurei, who made spicy frog curry; Marisa Kirisame, who made cheesy frog gratin; Sakuya Izayoi, who made elegant frog quiche; and many others.
               She lost every time, but she learned something new from each defeat.
        <p>She also traveled to different regions of Gensokyo, looking for rare and exotic frogs to cook.
             She met Letty Whiterock, an ice youkai who taught her how to make snow frogs; Eternity Larva, a butterfly fairy who showed her how to make rainbow frogs;
              Suwako Moriya, a goddess of frogs who gave her a divine blessing;
               and Yuuka Kazami, a flower master who warned her not to touch her precious sunflower frogs.</p>
        <p>After many adventures and misadventures, Cirno became a renowned chef in Gensokyo.
             She opened her own restaurant near the Misty Lake, called "Cirno's Frogtastic Cuisine".
              She attracted customers from all over the land, who came to try her unique and creative dishes.
               She also published a cookbook, titled "The Strongest Chef in Gensokyo: Cirno's Guide to Cooking Frogs".
                She was proud of her achievements, but she never forgot her humble beginnings. She still liked to freeze frogs and play with them,
                 because that was what made her happy.</p></div>
