            <br><h2>Frogs are a fine addition to any kinds of soup</h2>
            <p>One of Cirno's <em>favorite</em> things to do with a frog after freezing it in an ice cube is turning that baka <strong>straight into soup!</strong></p>
            <P>Although not good for flavoring soup, it is a good addition to soup for meat and extra sweatness</P><br><hr>


            <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 baka frogs that are 2 pounds, gutted and skinned</li>
                <li>2+2 (not fish) cups dashi</li>
                <li>1 cup water <em>optionally melted from Cirno's perfect freeze</em></li>
                <li>1/4 cup miso paste (shiro, aka, or a mix)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons wakame</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons wakame</li><br>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse baka frogs under cold water then set aside</li>
                <li>In medium-sized soup pot or saute pan, bring dashi to steady simmer. Place washed frogs in pot and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add miso paste to pot and incorporate into broth by pressing miso paste against edge of soup pot. Simmer for 5 minutes longer, until frog flesh is cooked through but still very tender. Add wakame to pot and let soften in broth.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately. Garnish with green onions.</li>
            </ol>
